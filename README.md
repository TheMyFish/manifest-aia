# The Augmented Intelligence AIOps (AIA) Manifest

The prevailing promise of AIOps has been one of total automationâ€”a future where systems heal themselves. Yet, this pursuit of autonomous remediation has often generated more skepticism than trust, treating the human engineer as a variable to be eliminated rather than a partner to be empowered.

We believe there is a better way. We believe the true power of AI in operations is not to replace human ingenuity, but to amplify it.

Through our work building and maintaining resilient software systems, we have come to value:

**Augmented Intelligence** over Autonomous Remediation.

**Developer Enablement** over Operator Replacement.

**Context and Understanding** over Alerts and Noise.

**Safe Evolution** over Risky Revolution.

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

### The 10 Principles of AIA

1.  **Our highest priority is to reduce the developer's cognitive load.** We free valuable human intellect from the repetitive toil of diagnosis so it can be focused on creative problem-solving.

2.  **The goal of automation is to prepare the work, not to perform it.** The system should deliver a high-quality starting point (a "Starter PR"), not a final commit. Control and judgment remain with the engineer.

3.  **A single alert must generate a complete dossier.** Automation should perform the forensic work of collecting logs, metrics, and traces, presenting a unified picture of the incident.

4.  **The primary output of AI is clarity, not code.** The system generates an "Insight Document" that explains the probable root cause, impact, and recommended actions, drawing not only on telemetry but on the organization's accumulated knowledge (runbooks, post-mortems).

5.  **Trust is built incrementally.** We begin in "read-only" mode, evolve to suggestions, and only then automate low-risk actions. Trust must be earned, not demanded.

6.  **Human oversight is a low-risk gate.** The human approval in the loop does not authorize a change to production, but rather the start of a workflow that accelerates the human response.

7.  **Disciplined observability is the foundational prerequisite.** A unified tagging strategy and an up-to-date software catalog are not optional; they are the bedrock upon which intelligence is built.

8.  **The system learns from every incident.** Each successful resolution, whether by AI or a human, enriches the knowledge base, making the system smarter and more relevant over time.

9.  **We measure success in Mean Time to Diagnosis (MTTD), not just MTTR.** The greatest efficiency gain comes from accelerating the understanding of the problem. Rapid resolution is a consequence of rapid understanding.

10. **Simplicity, in architecture and interaction.** The best tool is one that is easy to use, understand, and maintain. Complexity is the enemy of adoption.
